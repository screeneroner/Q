# Q Language Switcher and Keyboard Toolbox

Q operates with only **two languages at a time**. Usually, the **First Language** is English, activating by clicking the **Right Shift** key, and one of the **several Second Languages*, activating by *clicking the Right Ctrl* key, and typically presenting your *native language** or the **language of the country** of your current location. **Holding the Right Ctrl** key allows you to **choose which Second Language** from all installed you want to use for further input when you switch to it by clicking the Right Ctrl key.

Additionally, Q is equipped with **tools** that enhance text writing: **Transliterating** and **Text Case** changing, **Clipboard** text collecting, **Timestamp** texts, and **Screen Colors** features.

Beneficial tools are the **built-in Google Translator** and **Credentials Wallet**, which securely stores your sensitive information encrypted and enabling its **input without exposing on-screen**.

Most of them use the **same hotkey prefix Win+Alt** that can be easily pressed by the **large finger of the left hand**.
